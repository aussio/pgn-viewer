# Test Files for React Components
* All test files for React components must specify the jsdom environment using the // @vitest-environment jsdom directive at the top of the file. This ensures DOM APIs are available for component tests.
* All test files for React components must call cleanup() in afterEach to ensure the DOM is reset between tests. This prevents test pollution and ensures reliable, isolated tests.
