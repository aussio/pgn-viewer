# Test Files for React Components
* All test files for React components must specify the jsdom environment using the // @vitest-environment jsdom directive at the top of the file. This ensures DOM APIs are available for component tests.
* All test files for React components must call cleanup() in afterEach to ensure the DOM is reset between tests. This prevents test pollution and ensures reliable, isolated tests.
* All test files for React components must import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach, afterEach } from 'vitest' at the top of the file.
* All non-React test files must specify the node environment using // @vitest-environment node and import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest' at the top of the file.
